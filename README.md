## General info

This repository goal is to learn how to detect anomalies within different types of data such as transactions from a bank account or time series with the usage of unsupervised learning, novelty detection and data clustering.

## Requirements

The basic libraries for machine learning ðŸ˜ƒ

Libraries:
* Scikit-learn
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Project 1 - Fraud detection

In this project we will classify transactions from a bank account as fraudulent or normal.

The dataset used is from Vesta Corporation (on kaggle) through the competition: <a href= https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection> IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection</a>

*The dataset is quite heavy, you might experience issues with your RAM.*

Since the dataset is composed of 96.5% normal transactions and of only 3.5% fraudulent ones we are going to make an Anomaly Detection algorithm based on Novelty Detection (we train only on normal transactions).

For that we need an autoencoder which is an unsupervised Artificial Neural Network that attempts to encode the data by compressing it into the lower dimensions (bottleneck layer or code) and then decoding the data to reconstruct the original input.

Then we compute the reconstruction error between the prediction and the original data with a Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.

And finally we set a threshold error between normal and fraudulent transactions, normal transactions should be smaller and fraudulents bigger than the threshold.

The results are 81.11% of True positive and 60.71% of True negative.

Which mean frauds will be detected 60.71% of the time and normal transactions misclassified 18.89% of the time

## Project 2 - Time serie anomaly detection

For this project we'll apply the same idea as the last one: we make an autoencoder in order to compute a reconstruction error and we determine a threshold in order to detect anomalies in the time serie.

The difference in this project is that we have a new dimension which is time.
