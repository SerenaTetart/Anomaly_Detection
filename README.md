## General info

This project goal is to classify fraudulent transactions from normal ones through the usage of unsupervised learning, data clustering and autoencoder.

The dataset is from Vesta Corporation (on kaggle) through the competition: IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection

(https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection)

The network is an encoder as fully connected layer with L1 regularisation and relu activations.
